# Dynamic Cloud-Based Honeypot System
The Dynamic Cloud-Based Honeypot System is an intelligent, scalable cybersecurity solution designed to lure, detect, and analyze malicious activity in real-time. Built with modern cloud technologies, it empowers security teams with deep insights into attack patterns while proactively strengthening the defenses of critical systems.

# Key Features:
1. Dynamic Honeypot Deployment:

- Instantly spin up realistic decoy systems across cloud environments.
- Supports various honeypot types (web servers, databases, SSH endpoints) to attract diverse threat actors.
- Automated retirement and respawn of honeypots based on detected attack intensity.

2. Real-Time Attack Logging and Analysis:

- Capture detailed metadata on every intrusion attempt, including IP addresses, payloads, attack vectors, and timestamps.
- Aggregate logs for centralized analysis, providing rich datasets for threat intelligence.

3. Automated Adaptive Defense:

- Monitor honeypot traffic in real-time.
- Dynamically decommission compromised honeypots and deploy fresh instances to maintain deception integrity without manual intervention.
- Adjust honeypot configurations based on attack trends to continuously improve coverage.

4. Proactive Threat Intelligence:

- Build a live attack map showcasing sources and types of ongoing threats.
- Leverage collected data to inform security hardening of production environments.

5. Interactive Admin Controls:

- One-click simulations for data flows, failures, and unauthorized access scenarios.
- Real-time addition and removal of SCADA endpoints with geolocation integration.

6. Seamless Cloud Integration:

- Cloud-native design with support for major providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Auto-scaling and region-specific honeypot deployment options.


# Technology Stack:

- **React.js + Next.js:** For a dynamic, highly responsive admin interface.
- **Node.js + Express:** For backend orchestration and API endpoints.
- **Docker + Kubernetes:** For containerized honeypot deployment and scaling.
- **AWS/GCP/Azure SDKs:** For seamless cloud resource management.
- **ElasticSearch + Kibana:** For powerful attack log indexing, visualization, and analysis.
- **Tailwind CSS + Next UI:** To deliver a clean, modular, and accessible design system.
- **Socket.IO:** For real-time honeypot status updates and attack alerting.

# Purpose and Applications:
_This project is designed for cybersecurity teams, penetration testers, and cloud administrators aiming to:_

- Detect and understand real-world attack behavior before reaching production systems.
- Proactively strengthen security postures based on empirical data.
- Establish early-warning systems that adapt dynamically to evolving threats.

# Vision:

The Dynamic Cloud-Based Honeypot System redefines active defense in cybersecurity. By combining real-time threat detection, automated deception tactics, and rich analytics, it not only protects critical infrastructure but also empowers organizations to stay one step ahead of attackers.
It’s not just a defense tool — it’s a learning system that evolves with every threat encountered.
